# Werewolf
This is a simple werewolf web game for playing werewolf offline with friends. One phone is required for playing. 

## How it works
1. Start a game by configuring the roles to play in the game.
2. Pass the phone to the players for them to check their roles secretly.
3. The phone goes back to the mod and the app continues helping the mod to facilite the game
